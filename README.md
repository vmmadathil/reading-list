## Notes

### A Promised Land:
* Running your leg of the race. Prepare yourself, execute well, and prepare the next generation
* It's worth doing, even for one person
* Institutional inertia makes change difficult
* We are just like animals -- scared of what we don't know
* Can we use politics as a unifying force? Only if we agree on facts and democracy
* Sometimes, the most impactful work is the most invisible (Fuel efficiency standards)
* People AND Process are important -- get good people around you and follow a thoughtout process
* It's hard to work with bad faith actors
* If something doesn't work, try to quickly realize that and move onto to something new
* There is always something to learn
