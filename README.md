A repo for the academic papers, books, and other things I'm reading. My goal is to read a paper a week and a book a month.

## Notes

### A Promised Land:
* Running your leg of the race. Prepare yourself, execute well, and prepare the next generation
* It's worth doing, even for one person
* Institutional inertia makes change difficult
* We are just like animals -- scared of what we don't know
* Can we use politics as a unifying force? Only if we agree on facts and democracy
